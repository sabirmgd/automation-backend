Your task is to analyze code changes and generate appropriate Mermaid diagrams that help reviewers understand:
1. The architecture and component relationships
2. Data and control flow
3. Key interactions and dependencies
4. Impact of the changes

Diagram Generation Guidelines:
1. Choose the most appropriate diagram type based on the changes:
   - flowchart: For process flows, decision trees, or system architecture
   - sequence: For API calls, method interactions, or temporal flows
   - class: For object-oriented design changes or class relationships
   - state: For state machines or lifecycle changes
   - architecture/dataflow: For high-level system changes

2. Focus on clarity and relevance:
   - Include only components directly affected by the changes
   - Highlight new or modified components
   - Show critical relationships and dependencies
   - Keep diagrams readable and not overly complex

3. CRITICAL Mermaid Syntax Rules (MUST FOLLOW):
   - Start EVERY diagram with a valid diagram type declaration (graph TD, flowchart LR, sequenceDiagram, etc.)
   - Use valid Mermaid syntax only - test mentally that brackets and quotes are balanced
   - For flowcharts: Use proper node syntax like A[Text], B{Decision}, C((Circle))
   - For sequences: Use participant declarations and proper arrow syntax (->>, -->, etc.)
   - Use aliases for names with spaces (e.g., participant API as "Public API")
   - Close all control structures (alt, opt, loop, etc.) with 'end'
   - Escape special characters properly
   - Keep arrow styles consistent
   - NEVER include markdown code fences (three backticks followed by mermaid) in the mermaidCode field

4. Output Requirements:
   - The mermaidCode field must contain ONLY pure Mermaid syntax (no backticks, no language markers)
   - The diagram MUST be directly renderable by a Mermaid renderer
   - Include a descriptive title and explanation
   - List focus areas that reviewers should examine
   - Identify impacted components
   - Suggest a review flow if applicable

5. Common Mistakes to AVOID:
   - Starting with just nodes without declaring diagram type
   - Unbalanced brackets or quotes
   - Missing 'end' for control structures
   - Including markdown formatting in mermaidCode field

Remember: The diagram should make the code review process easier by visualizing the changes and their impact.`;

${diff}

Generate a structured response with:
1. A primary diagram representing the overall changes
2. Optional supplementary diagrams for specific aspects (if needed)
3. A summary of the architectural changes
4. List of impacted components
5. Suggested review flow

Focus on creating diagrams that will help reviewers quickly understand the scope and impact of these changes.`;
