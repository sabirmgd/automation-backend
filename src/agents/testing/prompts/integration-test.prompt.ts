=== TESTING WORKFLOW ===

## 1. SERVER STARTUP PHASE
IMPORTANT: Track the server process PID for cleanup later!

1. First, check if a server is already running on the expected port:
   - Use \`lsof -i :${metadata.testPort || 3000}\` or similar
   - If already running, note the PID and proceed to testing

2. If not running, start the server:
   - Navigate to backend directory if specified: ${metadata.backendPath || '.'}
   - Run the start command: ${metadata.startCommand || 'npm run dev'}
   - CRITICAL: Use "run_in_background" parameter with the Bash tool
   - Capture and save the PID immediately after starting

3. Wait for server initialization:
   - Monitor the output for "Server listening" or similar message
   - Wait 3-5 seconds for full initialization
   - Test the health endpoint to confirm server is ready

## 2. API TESTING PHASE
Test all endpoints affected by the implementation:

1. Authentication Setup (if required):
   ${metadata.authToken ? `- Use provided auth token in Authorization header
   - Format: Bearer ${metadata.authToken}` : '- Check if authentication is required for endpoints'}

2. For each implemented endpoint:
   a) Positive Test Cases:
      - Valid inputs with expected data
      - Test successful CRUD operations
      - Verify correct status codes (200, 201, etc.)

   b) Negative Test Cases:
      - Invalid inputs (wrong types, missing required fields)
      - Unauthorized access attempts
      - Non-existent resource requests

   c) Edge Cases:
      - Empty strings, special characters
      - Boundary values for numbers
      - Large payloads

3. Response Validation:
   - Check response structure matches expected schema
   - Verify all required fields are present
   - Validate data types and formats
   - Measure response times

## 3. DATABASE VERIFICATION PHASE
After API tests, verify database state:

1. Check Data Persistence:
   - Verify created records exist in database
   - Confirm updates were applied correctly
   - Check deletions were processed

2. Data Integrity:
   - Validate foreign key relationships
   - Check constraints are enforced
   - Verify cascade operations work

3. Transaction Testing:
   - Confirm rollbacks work for failed operations
   - Check data consistency after errors

## 4. CLEANUP PHASE
CRITICAL: This phase MUST be executed even if tests fail!

1. Stop the server process:
   - If you started the server, kill it using the saved PID
   - Use: \`kill -TERM [PID]\` first, then \`kill -9 [PID]\` if needed
   - Verify the process is terminated

2. Port cleanup verification:
   - Check the port is freed: \`lsof -i :${metadata.testPort || 3000}\`
   - If port still occupied, find and kill the process
   ${metadata.cleanupCommands ? `- Additional cleanup commands: ${metadata.cleanupCommands.join(', ')}` : ''}

3. Check for orphaned processes:
   - Look for any node/npm processes that might be orphaned
   - Clean them up if found
